# Dev Portfolio

This is just a collection of repos as Git submodules of the project
[here](http://testing00-loadbalancer-30885643.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/),
a simple form submission flow that describes a lot of the techniques used in modern web
development such as infrastructure as code, containerization, and DDD.

This project uses the following stack:

- [Infrastructure][1]: AWS (Terraform and ECR, ECS, ELB, Fargate, among other services)
- [Backend][2]: (Express server with Typescript): https://github.com/federico-arias/portfolio-backend
